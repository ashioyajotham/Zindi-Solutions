# [Tanzania Tourism Prediction by Pycon Tanzania Community](https://github.com/ashioyajotham/Zindi-Solutions/blob/main/tz-tourism.ipynb)

* The objective is to develop a machine learning model to predict what a tourist will spend when visiting Tanzania.
  The model can be used by different tour operators and the Tanzania Tourism Board to automatically help tourists across the world estimate their expenditure before visiting Tanzania.

# [UmojaHack Africa 2022: Faulty Air Quality Sensor Challenge (BEGINNER)](https://github.com/ashioyajotham/Zindi-Solutions/blob/main/Airqo%20Air%20Filter.ipynb)

* Device failure detection and monitoring is critical to AirQoâ€™s business; faulty devices need to be identified, isolated and fixed or replaced with urgency. Data received from a device can be used to identify whether the device is working correctly or not.
* Task is to develop a classification model to identify a device has an off set fault or not, regardless of the device. The model can be used by AirQo to automatically     flag a device that is returning faulty data. [Further info](https://zindi.africa/competitions/umojahack-africa-2022-beginner-challenge)
